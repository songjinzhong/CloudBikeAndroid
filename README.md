According to [official guide](https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/dev-kit-setup) Nexus 6P is the only phone supported as a **headset phone** for a Daydream development kit at this time.

Please watch [Designing & Developing for the Daydream Controller - Google I/O 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9OfmWnqR0M#t=07m44s)

Google VR Services was not available prior to version N of Android.

This project adds the package _com.google.vr.vrcore_ to fill the gap between SDK and controller.
